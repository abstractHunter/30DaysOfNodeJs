# Encryption and Decryption

## Encryption
`It deals with providing confidentiality to the data so that only 
authorize personnel have access to the data. In encryption , 
Plain text is transfromed to an unintelligible text with the 
help of key and algorithm which we can read but can not 
understand due to which the confidentiality of the data is 
protected. This unintelligible text is known as Cipher text`

The process of encryption is also known as encoding.`


## Decryption
`It is the process of rendering the data , so that it can be 
changed into a human or machine readable and understandable 
form. It takes the cipher text as input and converts it into the 
plain text with the help of key and algorithm`

The process of decryption is also known as decoding.


## Types of Encryption
1. Symmetric or private key Encryption
`same key is used to perform encryption and decryption`

2. Asymmetric Encryption
`two different keys are used to perform encryption and decryption`
