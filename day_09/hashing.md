# Hashing

### Hashing is a process of generating a fixed length value  from a string using mathematical functions. 
It is used for providing security.  

### Every hash generated is :
    - unique  
    - fixed length  
    - irreversible  


### Examples of different hashing algorithms
    - MD5 (message digest 5)
    - SHA1  (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)
    - SHA256  
    - SHA512


## hmac 
### HMAC ( keyed-hash message authentication code ) is a kind of MAC ( Message authentication code ) which involves performing the hash functions using a secret cryptographic key.
