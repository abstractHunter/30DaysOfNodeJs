# Debugging

(node inspect ${filename}) in console

A debugger is a program that helps us to debug the errors or bugs in a piece of code and to understand the flow of the program.


## Useful Debugger Commands
- `step`: Execute the next line of code.
- `next`: Execute the next line of code until the current function returns.
- `backtrace`: Show the call stack.
